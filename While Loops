Example1: 

 

//Output: 1 

                   2 

                   3 

                   4 

                   5 

 

int main() 

{ 

int index = 1;  

while(index <= 5){   //While the index is <= 5, the following print function will happen 

printf("%d\n", index); 

index = index + 1;   //At the end of each loop, index increases by 1  

                                  //You can rewrite variable = variable + 1 as variable++ 

} 

 

return 0; 

} 

 

Example2:  

 

/*The following program is a do-while loop. The difference between this and a while loop is that in a do-while loop, a function is performed and the variable is incremented before the condition is checked.*/ 

//Output: 6  

 

int main() 

{ 

int index = 6;  

do {   /*The following print function will be performed and the index will increment before  

          checking the condition.*/ 

printf("%d\n", index); 

index = index + 1;     

} while(index <= 5); 

 

return 0; 

}
